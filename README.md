# burger

<a href="https://pure-forest-39063.herokuapp.com/">Go here for a live version on Heroku!</a>

This was an app, that used Sql, Express, handlebars, and a couple others to gather requests from the user to order a burger!

The user is asked to make a request, and when the oder is submitted and ready for pick up, you will click the cashout button, 
and it will go to the next column where the user will then theoretically eat the burger, and when you are finished you can, click the trash can and it will delete it.


You will start this project by first running:
- npm Init
- npm Install 
- & changing the Db configuration settings to your own.
